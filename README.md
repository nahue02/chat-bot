# Vue Chatbot Assistant

A visual playground to design and test conversational logic using a node-based interface.

### About

I started this project to practice **Vue 3** and some state management. I wanted to try building something entertaining, and this is what I came up with. Hope you enjoy it.

Feel free to mess around. Create infinite loops, delete all the nodes, or try to break the logic completely. Just have fun exploring how it works.

### Tools used

- **Vue 3**
- **Vue Flow** (for the visual graph)
- **Vuetify** (for styles)
